				<h1> The Mood Board</h1>
				<p> Eldesteel is my newest worldbuilding project. This one came as a combination of a new character design plot, making a new D&D character, and tossing in inspiration from Arcane (because the brainrot is BAD)<br><br>

				The theme of this one is a steampunk/fantasy nature esque world, where machinery and nature co-exist and can survive with one another (like Horizon Zero Dawn), with fantasy magic elements of D&D and dystopian steampunk of Arcane. </p>

				<h1> SKETCHES</h1>
				<p> This is the work in progress part: the character I'm making for this world. This isn't the final design, but it is the only one I sorta finished. <br><br>

				Their name is Soliel and they are a Forest Druid that becomes a warforged elf after a bad accident left them for dead. They loathe all things machines, and they have a partner who is an artificer and responsible for quite literally piecing them back together and bringing them to life.</p>
