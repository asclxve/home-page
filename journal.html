		<h1>Website is a Shifting House…</h1>
		<p>
			A website is a container, a room, wall, anything we choose to decorate it with. 
			A website is a device, a book, a tool, a medium for our malleable plans to take place. <br><br>
 			A website is a structure, a mainframe, a window into ideals hidden deep inside. 
			A website is a storybook, a passage, word vomit.<br><br>
			But most of all, a website is just that. A website

		<h1>A Rant on Technology</h1>
		<p>
			Technology is a tool meant to help us learn the world, but somehow we don’t know much about the world. We see it all the time in social media, but what are we actually seeing? Are we really seeing the world or the number count by the eyeball icon and like icon? And it’s definitely more than the shiny metal boxes that keep our eyes from truly taking everything in around us. It’s supposed to help us explore the world…so why aren’t we?

		<h1>A Handmade Web</h1>
		<p>
			Reading through this, one quote stuck out to me: <br><br>

		“I evoke the term ‘handmade web’ in corder to make a correlation between handmade web pages and handmade print materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artist books.”<br><br>

		Websites are always being made nowadays but the term handmade web makes it feel more intimate simply because it’s not attached to a website builder. It’s made completely by your own code. One could even say…handmade…(Weak pun, I’ll see myself out).

		<h1>Hello World</h1>
		<p>
			Humans as computers…I never really thought as humans of computers but it does make sense when you think about it. I’ve heard of human brains essentially being computers for human bodies, which makes sense, but not humans. The combination of text and handwriting and drawings definitely reinforce the idea of handmade web and computers…I mean, it all connects when you really think about it.

		<p>
			Ding. We need to meet for this project even though there’s no room in the schedule.<br><br>

			Ding. <br><br>

		<h1>The Internet's Back-to-the-Land Movement</h1>
		<p>
			Ah yes, one of many sounding alarms to care for our environment that continues to suffer because of selfish natures at the top want to keep the system that is outdated but feeds their bottomless pockets.<br><br>
			Visions of how to combat this would work in theory…but the corporate greed corrupts and twists the visions, and oh look at that, we’re back at square one. How lovely. Not...
